# MyClearEmotions

My Clear Emotions is an app aimed at children to help display or convey their emotions. Designed mainly for autistic or impaired children, it can help any child with any problem related to feelings explain their emotion to others using just the app.

Children just click on the emotion they are closest to feeling. A full screen version of the emotion is shown, which children can then present to a viewer. To change they click the 'change emotion' button which takes them back to the main screen.

Bright coloured monster characters are used, the current images in use are [designed by Freepik](http://www.freepik.com). More emotions to be added at a later date, possibly with original character designs substituted for the current images.
